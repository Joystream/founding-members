## `Scoring Period 7`
### _10/05/21 - 24/05/21_
<br>

#### Announcement

_Scoring Period #7 is now live!_

<!---
We will start grading summaries for Period #5 after 29th April and will publish the scores well in advance of the next scoring period (Period #7).

There's nothing particularly notable about this round, though we would like to remind all participants to consider our feedback from the previous rounds when deciding how to contribute and how to properly report their activities.

Particularly important is to ensure that you provide accurate dates for your activities and make it clear for which periods you are claiming the activity.

We would also like to remind participants in the scheme that the Founding Member program is aimed at finding high-quality contributors who will help run the platform on mainnet. We are looking for high-quality contributions over an extended period of time in order for you to qualify as a member of this initiative.

Some participants currently seem to be focussed on quite low impact activities, such as making generic tweets, uploading low-quality videos or setting up a node and then not engaging with the testnet any further. While we of course appreciate all contributions, these types of low-effort contribution do not really make the project any more valuable, and consequently are not sufficient for those hoping to become Founding Members. You can look to the contributions of some of the already inducted Founding Members to understand the kinds of participation we are most impressed by.


#### Processing Note

_Once we have processed all of the summaries submitted in this period and inducted any new founding members etc., a processing note will be added here with comments and some suggestions for the next scoring period._

_For submitted summaries that are lacking, incomplete or contain errors, we may contact you on Keybase to resolve the issue(s)._
