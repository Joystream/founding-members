### Note on "Initial Founding Members"
_Although all existing community members were given the opportunity to claim points through the summary submission system for their contributions which were made before this program was launched, we agreed that for some of our most active and engaged participants, it was neither practical nor fair to have them formally account for all of their many contributions to the project which took place over months of participation._

_Instead, these members were automatically inducted as `Initial Founding Members`. This doesn't give them any extra status or leaderboard points, but they have been awarded some additional tokens as part of a pool separate from the rest of the program._
