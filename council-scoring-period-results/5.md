### Builders
```
BUILDER_SCORE = [GENERAL_WG_SCORE + REPORT_SCORE + TESTING_SCORE + DEVELOPMENT_SCORE]/4
= [0.767 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2]/4 = 0.342
```
#### `GENERAL_WG_SCORE`
```
GENERAL_SCORE = [SUMMARY_SCORE + PLAN_SCORE + WORKER_OPPORTUNITIES_SCORE]/(3*2^{N+M})
= [0.5 + 0.8 + 1] = 0.767
```

#### `REPORT_SCORE`
Stricter grading this time.
- Except for what was completed, all details are missing.
- No time estimated provided.
0.2

#### `TESTING_SCORE`
```
  If ISSUES_TESTED >= 20:     1
  If 5 < ISSUES_TESTED < 20:  1-((20-ISSUES_TESTED)/15)
  If ISSUES_TESTED =< 5:      0

ISSUES_TESTED = 8 -> 0.2
```

#### `DEVELOPMENT_SCORE`
```
  If STORY_POINTS >= 15:      1
  If 5 < STORY_POINTS < 15:  1-((15-STORY_POINTS)/10)
  If STORY_POINTS =< 5:      0

STORY_POINTS = 5 -> 0
```

### Content

```
CONTENT_SCORE = [GENERAL_WG_SCORE + REPORT_SCORE + FEATURING_SCORE + MODERATION_SCORE]/(4*2^{N})
= [0.033 + 0.05 + 0 + 0]/(4*2^0) = 0.021
```

#### `GENERAL_WG_SCORE`
```
GENERAL_SCORE = [SUMMARY_SCORE + PLAN_SCORE + WORKER_OPPORTUNITIES_SCORE]/(3*2^{N+M})
= 0.033
```

* `SUMMARY_SCORE`
The report was posted on the forum, but failed to address any of these items meaningfully.
0.1

* `PLAN_SCORE`
No plan found.

* `WORKER_OPPORTUNITIES_SCORE`
0

#### `REPORT_SCORE`
A report was published, however, it did not meet the requirements set out in the scoring protocol in a reasonable manner.

There was some focus on identifying duplicate assets and stating moderation actions which had taken place, though not in a manner which is comprehensible outside of the working group.

There was no information at all on anything related to featured content, perhaps since no actions had been taken in this area.

The resultant score is 0.05.


#### `FEATURING_SCORE`
No featuring took place during the round, consequently the score is zero.

#### `MODERATION_SCORE`
The overwhelming number of videos which should have been moderated and were not results in a score of zero.


### Distributors
```
DISTRIBUTOR_SCORE = [GENERAL_WG_SCORE + REPORT_SCORE + THUMBNAIL_SCORE + PLAYABLITIY_SCORE + SERVICE_SCORE]/(5*2^{N})
=[0.033 + 0.8 + 0.6 + 1 + 0.712]/5 = 0.629
```

#### `GENERAL_WG_SCORE`
```
GENERAL_SCORE = [SUMMARY_SCORE + PLAN_SCORE + WORKER_OPPORTUNITIES_SCORE]/(3*2^{N+M})
= 0.033
```

* `SUMMARY_SCORE`
The report was posted on the forum, but failed to address any of these items meaningfully.
0.1

* `PLAN_SCORE`
No plan found.

* `WORKER_OPPORTUNITIES_SCORE`
0

#### `REPORT_SCORE`
Most items addressed, and fairly well presented.
0.8

#### `THUMBNAIL_SCORE`
```
  avg_rendering = Zigma[max((2000-avg_rendering_time_i)/1000,1)]/i
  max_rendering_score = max((3000-avg_rendering_time_i/1000),1)

  # finally
  THUMBNAIL_SCORE = 0.6*avg_rendering + 0.4*max_rendering_score
````
Found (all performed 28.04):
- `avg_rendering_time`: 971ms
- `max_rendering_time`: 3080ms

```
THUMBNAIL_SCORE = 0.6*avg_rendering + 0.4*max_rendering_score
= 0.6*1 + 0.4*0 = 0.6
```


#### `PLAYABLITIY_SCORE`
```
avg_configured_sources_score = Zigma[max(avg_configured_sources_i-2.5,1)]/i
  min_configured_sources_score = Zigma[max(min_configured_sources-2,1)]/i
  unavailable_distributors_score = Zigma[max(1-unavailable_distributors_i,1)]/i

  # finally
  PLAYABLITIY_SCORE = 0.3*(avg_configured_sources_score + min_configured_sources_score) + 0.4*unavailable_distributors_score
```
Note that this will be changed in the future, as it turns out to be a flawed metric.

#### `SERVICE_SCORE`
```
  avg_download_ratio_score = Zigma[max(avg_download_ratio_i-1,1)]/i
  min_download_ratio_score = Zigma[max(min_download_ratio_i-0.5,1)]/i
  avg_buffering_score = Zigma[max((5-avg_buffering_i)/3,1)]/i
  max_buffering_score = Zigma[max((10-max_buffering_i)/6,1)]/i

  # finally
  service_score = 0.25*(avg_download_ratio_score + min_download_ratio_i + avg_buffering_i + max_buffering_i)
```
Found (all performed 26.04):
- `avg_download_ratio_score`: 53.8 `*`
- `min_download_ratio_score`: 0.992  `*`
- `avg_buffering`: 1790ms (after outliers removed) `**`
- `max_buffering`: 7866ms (after outliers removed) `**`

`*` Downloaded videos 3 videos from 15 different distributor nodes.
`**` 15 distributor nodes were tested 5 times each. Removed outliers if > 25% higher than the other result for the node.

```
service_score = 0.25(1 + 0.492 + 1.0 + 0.356) = 0.712
```

### HR

```
HR_SCORE = [GENERAL_WG_SCORE + REPORT_SCORE + GREETING_SCORE + BOUNTY_GENERATION_SCORE]/(4*2^{N})
= [0.867 + 0.6 + 0 + 0]/(4*2^0) = 0.367
```

#### `GENERAL_WG_SCORE`
```
GENERAL_SCORE = [SUMMARY_SCORE + PLAN_SCORE + WORKER_OPPORTUNITIES_SCORE]/(3*2^{N+M})
= [0.8 + 0.8 + 1] = 0.867
```
* `PLAN_SCORE`
Late, but done exactly as required.
0.8

* `SUMMARY_SCORE`
Very well done, besides one or two pieces of information missing.
0.8

* `WORKER_OPPORTUNITIES_SCORE`
1

#### `REPORT_SCORE`

A report was published which attempted to meet the requirements set out in the scoring protocol. However, it was weakened by the fact that the bounty aspect of the report was not addressed properly, since no bounties were assigned to people joining the #start-here channel. However, there was clearly a sincere attempt to generate a report following the criteria, therefore the REPORT_SCORE is 0.6.

#### `GREETING_SCORE`

* `TIMELINESS_SCORE`

Some participants were not responded to, which from the perspective of the timeliness score is an automatic zero.

* `ONBOARDING_SCORE`

No new participants were added to the CRM during the period. Therefore the score here is zero.

However, some integrators were not given permissions in the CRM quickly enough, which only partially justifies this.

#### `BOUNTY_SCORE`

A number of bounties were created, however, they were not assigned to any new joiners in the #start-here channel. The resultant score is zero.


### Storage
```
STORAGE_SCORE = [GENERAL_WG_SCORE + REPORT_SCORE + MAINTENANCE_SCORE + UPLOAD_SCORE]/(4*2^{N})
= [0.1 + 1 + 1 + 0]/4 = 0.525
```

#### `GENERAL_WG_SCORE`
```
GENERAL_SCORE = [SUMMARY_SCORE + PLAN_SCORE + WORKER_OPPORTUNITIES_SCORE]/(3*2^{N+M})
=[0.3+0+0]/3 = 0.1
```
Note: the `PLAN_SCORE` and `WORKER_OPPORTUNITIES_SCORE` was weighted to 0, so not included unless positive.

* `SUMMARY_SCORE`
The report was missing:
- Not posted on forum
- Hires/fires/slashes
- Proposed bounties were submitted late
- No Notion changes mentioned
- No summary
- No suggested changes
