## Grading by Group
General notes:
- The `GENERAL_WG_SCORE` score will, starting from next scoring period, be graded much more strictly in general.
  - Council should enforce a template for plans and summaries
  - Push the groups on deadlines
  - Make sure the body of the plan + summary is posted on the forum
    - It's fine if some extra statistics, and the WG specific reports are not
- Many groups will see significant changes to their metrics.
  - If the WG Leads, or the Council, has inputs - now would be the time.
- There will be some inconsistency on how grading is applied. This may be unfair to the Leads (ref keeping the role), but for the Council it doesn't really matter, as it can't be inconsistent one way.

### Council
#### `PLAN_SCORE`
- No clear plan found, just high level bullet points
- Not clear where the plan ends, and the summary begins
- Some nice stats
- Can't punish much, due to slow feedback
- Will be much stricter
0.75

#### `SUMMARY_SCORE`
- Spending mostly correct, but some are a bit off.
- Not clear if any _leads_ were hired/fired/slashed.
- No feedback, suggestions or recommendations (in written form, more in calls)
0.3

#### `HANDOVER_SCORE`
- Good turnout!
- No agenda presented
0.9

#### `LEAD_OPPORTUNITIES_SCORE`
- No Leads hired, but error in formulae

### Builders
```
BUILDER_SCORE = [GENERAL_WG_SCORE + REPORT_SCORE + TESTING_SCORE + DEVELOPMENT_SCORE]/4
= [0.933 + 0.8 + 0 + 0]/4 = 0.433
```

#### `GENERAL_WG_SCORE`
```
GENERAL_SCORE = [SUMMARY_SCORE + PLAN_SCORE + WORKER_OPPORTUNITIES_SCORE]/(3*2^{N+M})
= 0.933
```
Note: the `PLAN_SCORE` and `WORKER_OPPORTUNITIES_SCORE` was weighted to 0, so not included unless positive.

* `SUMMARY_SCORE`
There are 9 bullet points to [address](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-M-C0Rf1ILeSmMugzduG/s/8ujeNdjza15ubRKR1XBX/testnet/council-period-scoring/general-working-group-score).
- All but two issues addressed
- Data appears to be correct
- Posted on the forum
- Initially published on time, minor edits only after
0.9

* `PLAN_SCORE`
- Posted on the forum.
- Late, but no punishment for that.
1

* `WORKER_OPPORTUNITIES_SCORE`
1

General:
- Request templates (from the Council)
- Make forum posts, as required.
- Please separate the plan, the summary and report in different documents

#### `REPORT_SCORE`
- Almost everything addressed
- Missing a time estimate for the work completed, which is very useful for adjusting the targets
- Although many other groups has gotten feedback that the reports should be separate, it's rather clear what is what
0.8

#### `TESTING_SCORE`
```
TESTING_SCORE:
  If ISSUES_TESTED >= 20:     1
  If 5 < ISSUES_TESTED < 20:  1-((20-ISSUES_TESTED)/15)
  If ISSUES_TESTED =< 5:      0
```
Only one issue tested. It may be that the targets has to be reduced, but still 0.

#### `DEVELOPMENT_SCORE`
```
DEVELOPMENT_SCORE:
  If STORY_POINTS >= 15:      1
  If 5 < STORY_POINTS < 15:  1-((15-STORY_POINTS)/10)
  If STORY_POINTS =< 5:      0
```
5 SP points achieved. Looks like it was merged a while back.
It may be that the targets has to be reduced, but still 0.

### Content
```
CONTENT_SCORE = [GENERAL_WG_SCORE + REPORT_SCORE + FEATURING_SCORE + MODERATION_SCORE]/(4*2^{N})

#### `GENERAL_WG_SCORE`
```
GENERAL_SCORE = [SUMMARY_SCORE + PLAN_SCORE + WORKER_OPPORTUNITIES_SCORE]/(3*2^{N+M})
= 0.1

No indication anything was done or attempted.

#### `MODERATION_SCORE`
No censoring done, no indication it has been attempted. No spot check done, so grading will simply be set to 0.5.

General:
- Request templates (from the Council)
- Please separate the plan, the summary and report in different documents

#### `REPORT_SCORE`
= 0.70

The report submitted by the HR Working Group met some of the requirements outlined, particularly in the tracking of greeting activity.

However, due to the lack of bounties created, no information on bounties is offered in the report. Since this is the principal focus of HR reports, the report is substantially weakened.

It was not necessary to create bounties as part of onboarding in this period. And phrases such as these seem to misunderstand the purpose of the working group.

#### `GREETING_SCORE`
```
TIMELINESS_SCORE = max(delta_t_a/10,1)

GREETING_SCORE = (TIMELINESS_SCORE + ONBOARDING_SCORE)/2
= (0.65+0.68)/2 = 0.665
```

`TIMELINESS_SCORE`
- Instead of using this formula, which it became apparent was not comprehensible for WG members, an analysis of the average response time was performed.
- Not all new joiners were responded to promptly during this Council Period, and some were not responded to at all.
- The average (mean) response time for messages in the #start-here channel exceeded 10 minutes. Ideally responses should be instant during working hours, so this is a poor result.
-> 0.65

`ONBOARDING_SCORE`
- Since some issues with the CRM and permissions prevented certain integrators from adding new participants.
- But there was also to some degree a lack of initiative in adding new people even given the limitations and seeking the permissions required.
->  0.68

#### `BOUNTY_SCORE`
There was no evidence that this task had been addressed in a meaningful way by the working group, consequently, the score is zero.
-> 0

### Storage
```
STORAGE_SCORE = [GENERAL_WG_SCORE + REPORT_SCORE + MAINTENANCE_SCORE + UPLOAD_SCORE]/(4^{N})
