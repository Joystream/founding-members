# Founding Member Avatars

### What Are Avatars For?

As part of the process of being formally admitted and inducted into the Founding Member program, you will be asked to select a custom illustrated avatar for the duration of your membership of the program.

You can use your avatar anywhere you would like, though you are particularly encouraged to use the avatar on Joystream products, such as in Pioneer and in our media consumption application.

Your avatar is unique to you, and is yours forever. You are free to modify or edit it as much as you like to suit the context you want to use it in.
You will even be able to use it on the Joystream platform on mainnet.

We will also display your avatar on our leaderboards on `joystream.org` and in our social media channels when recognizing your contributions to the project.

This repo holds a number of different variants of each avatar, which can be compared below.

#### Primary Avatar

These can be found in the `/primary-avatar/` folder.
