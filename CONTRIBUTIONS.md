# List of non-bounty useful contributions

[CONTRIBUTIONS.MD]

## Summary

The scoring system for our leaderboard will be very dynamic and reward a wide range of possible contributions to the success of the project.
Below are a list of some potential contributions and the approximate number of points you might expect for performing a particular task.
These numbers are for very rough guidance purposes only, and all points are ultimately awarded based on the judgement of Jsgenesis reviewers.

As we learn more about the evolving ways in which our community can contribute, we will update this list with further tasks and associated scores.

### Example Tasks

Network Integrity:
- running a validator [indicative score: 50 per day]
  - since running even a validator node contributes to the security of the platform and allows you to hook yourself up to the heart of our network, we want to recognize and reward this common and relatively straightforward first step towards further engagement in the project.
  - because there is little additional benefit in terms of learning about the project from setting up more than one node, we are likely to offer smaller rewards for further nodes you set up, though these will still qualify for rewards.
  - you should also be aware that validators can earn further formal rewards on our current testnet


Community Communication:
- discussing the project on twitter/discord/telegram/reddit [indicative score: 10 -> 100]
  - sharing information and opinions about our project with others through social channels is a key way in which we can help drive more people to the platform
  - participating in meaningful discourse about Joystream will be rewarded, while remotely spammy activity will be disqualified from receiving points
- managing localised groups/communities [indicative score: variable based on quality, engagement and amount of time invested]
  - we are keen to make Joystream open to people from all over the world, and realise that Joystream enthusiasts may not always be native English speakers.
  - the creation of specific language Telegram or other chat groups about Joystream where members in a specific locality can discuss the project is certainly useful, and if done succesfully may be rewarded with leaderboard points.
- writing blog posts about joystream [indicative score: 500->5000, will vary greatly depending on quality]
  - we are keen for community members to explain aspects of the platform to new members, and blog posts on Medium or your personal blog etc. are a great way to share information, tutorials or your thoughts about the project.
- making interesting posts on the platform forum [indicative score: 20->200 per post]
  - the on-chain platform forum aims to be the hub of communication between our community members, so enriching this community space with high-quality posts is strongly encouraged and will receive generous rewards
- webinar/workshop/meetup [indicative score: 1000->10000 per event]
  - if you would like to organise some sort of event to discuss the platform, this is strongly encouraged
  - funding may also be available from the Council for these kinds of initiatives
- providing support in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DE9UN3YpRP) [indicative score: 25->200 per issue]
  - providing effective help to fellow participants and especially guiding new joiners through Discord is a critically important way in which our community can ensure its continued growth and ensure new participants are not lost in the broad scope of the project
- community proposals [indicative score: 500->5000 per proposal]
  - if you have a big idea about some project, bounty or other improvement for the community, you can share it with us on GitHub, the platform forum or using the proposals system
  - depending on whether Jsgenesis and the community likes your idea, it is likely to be eligible for leaderboard points (in addition to funding via the platform)

<!--
Accessibility:
- translations [indicative score: 250 per 500 words, depending on quality and subject to review/verification]
  - translations are very important to make the project accessible to as many people as possible, and we will reward translation of important documents with leaderboard points
  - note that making original content or tutorials in other languages about the project will also qualify for rewards, though in some cases will warrant less than the equivalent contribution in English
-->

Enriching Testnet:
- improving content metadata and reporting issues to content curators [indicative score: 5->10 per correction]
  - it's important that video content displayed on our testnet looks good, and if there are any issues with incorrect metadata, license, playback or associated media these should be reported to the Content Curators
- original content uploads [indicative score: 500->3000 per upload, depending on quality]
  - one of the simplest to add value to the network is by adding your own content to our content directory, as a result we will generously reward such contributions.
- uploading tutorial videos [indicative score: 450->2500 per tutorial, depending on quality]
  - tutorial videos are an excellent medium for helping people to get to grips with participating on the platform while also augmenting our growing library of content.
- uploading unique content to the platform [indicative score: 150->700 per upload, depending on uniqueness]
  - content uploaded doesn't all have to be strictly original, and public domain and creative commons-licensed uploads will also be eligible rewards if they are unique or interesting
  - duplicate and low quality uploads will not qualify for rewards and content which is improperly licensed or breaks our Terms of Service may result in further penalties
- creating channels [indicative score: variable]
  - as part of the above, organizing content uploaded into distinct channels with specific themes or content types will increase rewards

Coding [indicative score: 7500+]:
- developing tools outside the scope of official bounties (such as wallets, faucet, Discord/Telegram Bots, block explorers etc.), optionally through requesting funding through a Council spending proposal represent very valuable contributions to the project and will be rewarded generously with Founding Member points.
- completing coding bounties will also be rewarded (see `Regular Contributions` below)

Creative/Design [indicative score: 200+ per asset depending on quality]:
- designing media assets including illustations, gifs, memes and infographics to be used by Jsgenesis and other project participants will be rewarded generously with leaderboard points.

Security:
- identifying bugs [indicative score: low severity: 1000, medium severity: 5000, high severity: 25000+]
  - it is of critical importance that security issues in Joystream are identified and patched
  - participants who draw attention to or write detailed vulnerability reports about issues with our testnet will therefore be rewarded.

Testing:
- feedback/suggestions on joystream products [indicative score: 500]
  - users who provide feedback on Joystream applications and offer suggestions for improvements (either through GitHub issues or on the platform forum) will receive leaderboard points
- detailed testing of joystream products [indicative score: 2500+ depending on scope]
  - those who want to conduct formal QA testing are likely to be rewarded to an even greater degree than the above

Regular Contributions [indicative score: variable!]:
- Bounties
  - The completion of official bounties can be included in your regular Founding Member summary and these will usually result in points being awarded. The number of leaderboard points will be proportional to the reward value of the bounty.
- KPIs
  - If you can provide evidence that you played a significant role in the Council achieving a specific KPI, you can also include this in your regular summary.
- Roles
  - Ongoing participation in platform roles will also qualify for leaderboard points.

Referrals:
- Referring other people to the project who go on to submit leaderboard summaries will also qualify for rewards (they don't have to ultimately become Founding Members, just earn points).
  - At the moment the referral bonus is 20%, meaning you will earn 0.2x the points earned by your referrals.
